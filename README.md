# Cromemco-Dazzler-RevD

PCB layouts for the Cromemco Dazzler RevD boards in KiCAD format. Now including Gerbers.

This repository contains two PCB layouts for a replica of the Cromemco Dazzler S100 video card. 

This will require the original vintage components to construct.

The original layout work has been performed by Gary Clark from North West Computer Museum.

PCB artwork was created by Hugo Holden of the Vintage Computer Federation.
